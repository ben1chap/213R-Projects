    "Model Selection: Did you try multiple models? Why did you choose these models? How do they work? What are they assumptions? And how did you test/account for them? How did you select hyper-parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model interpretation: What do the model results tell you? Which variables are important? High bias or variance and how did you / could you fix this? How confident are you in your results?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model usefulness: Do you think your final model was useful? If so, how would you recommend using it?\n",

    "Convince us, that if we were a company, we would feel comfortable using your model with our users. Think about edge cases as well - are there certain areas that the model performs poorly on? Best on? How would you handle these cases, if say Zillow wanted to leverage your model realizing that bad recommendations on sale prices would hurt customer trust and your brand. This section also falls into the storytelling aspect of the grading."
